# Minimum setup needed to run the project

## Docker

You need to have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed to run this project. If you don't have it installed you can follow [this guide](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for `docker` and [this one](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) for `docker-compose`.

- First clone this repository.
- After that open your terminal of preference and navigate to the directory you cloned this project.
- Add the neccessary environment variables for the server in its own `.env` file
- type the command `docker-compose up`

## Scripts used on the project

### Server side

- `npm start`: starts the application
- `npm run build`: Compiles the code from ES6 to ES5.
- `npm run dev`: Starts the application in a development environment
- `npm run lint`: Check the code based on `eslint` rules
- `npm run prettier`: Check the code based on `prettier` rules

### Client side

- `npm start`: run the app in development mode
- `npm run build`: builds the app for production to the build folder
- `npm run test`: Runs the test watcher in an interactive mode.
